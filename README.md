Dustbin IoT Prototype

The Dustbin-IoT prototype was a quick sketch made in a month with the *NodeRed* framework. It allowed me to understand what challenges I would face throughout the final project and be better prepared for them. <br>
As a result, I was able to complete the real project in less than a week without problems.
