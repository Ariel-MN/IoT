# Dustbin IoT Prototype


The Dustbin-IoT Prototype was a quick sketch of the current project. It allowed me to understand what challenges I would face throughout the realization of the final project and be better prepared for them.

As a result, I was able to complete the real project in less than a week without problems.

**Technologies:**

- Python 3.8.0 | https://www.python.org/downloads
- MongoDB as DB | https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
- NodeRed as Framework | https://nodered.org
