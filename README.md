Dustbin IoT Prototype

The Dustbin-IoT Prototype was a quick sketch with the **NodeRed** framework of the actual project. It allowed me to understand what challenges I would face throughout the realization of the final project and be better prepared for them.

As a result, I was able to complete the real project in less than a week without problems.
